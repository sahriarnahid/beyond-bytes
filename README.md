## Hey there! 👋

I'm **Nahid**, and this is my little corner of the internet where I dump everything I learn about programming. No corporate BS, no fluff – just real talk about code, the struggles, the wins, and the random 3 AM discoveries that make this whole journey worth it.

## What's Inside? 🎯

**Programming Guides** that actually make sense • **Comprehensive CS Resources** for students and professionals • **Tech reviews** without the marketing speak • **Curated Learning Lists** I actually use (not just bookmarked) • **Stories** from the trenches of development

### Latest Addition 📚
**Essential Resources for Computer Science Students** - A comprehensive, curated collection of 200+ educational websites, tools, and platforms organized by category to help CS students excel in their studies and career preparation.

## Cool Features ✨

- **Lightning fast** ⚡ because ain't nobody got time for slow sites
- **Mobile-friendly** 📱 for those late-night coding sessions in bed
- **Smart search** 🔍 to find that thing you read last month
- **Clean design** 🎨 that won't hurt your eyes
